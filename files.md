title: Programming Files
subtitle: Program your radios with Repeater Roundabout repeaters.
---

In order to make the contesting life a little easier, we provide a CHIRP-compatible file to program your radios. These files are automatically generated each time a new repeater is added. **The Channel number in each file corresponds to the repeater's "Repeater Roundabout Number" (RR#) which you need to log in the contest.**


## Downloads

- [CHIRP file](assets/programming_files/rr_frequencies.csv) (.csv)
- [AnyTone D878 file](assets/programming_files/d878.zip) (.zip)

<!-- 
Which file do you need ?

- The <a href="assets/programming_files/all_rr_frequencies.csv" download><b>All Repeaters file</b></a> contains every repeater that is participating in the Repeater Roundabout. It is not formatted for any particular radio, but you should be able to modify it for your software and radio of choice.
- The <a href="assets/programming_files/rr_frequencies.csv" download><b>Chirp file</b></a> is helpful for radios that are programmable by Chirp. It does not include DMR or DSTAR repeaters.
- The [**AnyTone D878 file**](assets/programming_files/d878.zip) is specifically for the AnyTone D878 radio. It includes DMR and YSF repeaters.
- The [**Icom IC-705 file**](assets/programming_files/icom.csv) is specifically for the Icom IC-705 radio. It includes DSTAR and YSF repeaters.
- The <a href="assets/programming_files/internet.csv" download><b>internet connectivity file</b></a> contains Echolink and Allstar information for relevant repeaters.

Many thanks to [Mike K7MCK](https://www.qrz.com/db/k7mck) for contributing code to generate the AnyTone D878 and Icom IC-705 files, and for the videos you see below on programming your radios specifically for the Repeater Roundabout. Further thanks to [Jeff AB6MB](https://www.qrz.com/db/ab6mb) for putting together the <a href="assets/programming_files/internet.csv" download><b>internet connectivity file</b></a> ! Please consider this a draft and note there are likely some errors; if you find one, please report it ! -->


## Help programming radios

### Chirp

[Chirp](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) is a free, open-source tool for
programming a large number of radios.

1. You'll want to check that Chirp [supports your radio](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Supported_Radios). 
2. You will need a programming cable that works with your radio. Chirp has [a guide on the subject](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/CableGuide), and Dave Casler KE0OG has [a video on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzkFVtyttKM) for some of the common Chinese radios.
3. [Install Chirp](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Download) on your computer.
4. You are now ready to test [cloning from your radio](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Beginners_Guide). If this works, your radio and computer are correctly communicating, and you are ready to write our <a href="assets/programming_files/rr_frequencies.csv" download>CSV file</a>. Dave Casler has [a good video to get you started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mrpqq-xi00g).

For more information, check out [Chirp's Wiki](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home).

### AnyTone D878

Our <a href="assets/programming_files/d878.zip" download>download for the
D878</a> is a zip file containing three files :
- `d878.csv` contains all of the repeater information (frequencies, offsets, tones)
- `d878-scanlist.csv` contains information that allows you to scan across all repeaters in the
  Roundabout

Run the [CPS software](https://support.bridgecomsystems.com/anytone-878-v2-model-cps-firmware-downloads):

1. Select the `Tools > Import` menu and select each of the files you've downloaded in the
appropriate category (Channel, Scan List, and/or Talk Groups).
2. Add all the channels to a Zone:
   <br>Click on the Zone in the side-panel
   <br>Double click the No. 1 Zone row - you should see this Zone dialog:
   <img style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: 1em auto;" src="assets/images/zone-dialog.png">
   Select all the channels by selecting the first channel and then SHIFT-selecting the last channel.
   <br>Press the `>>` button to copy all the channels to the zone.
   <br>You can also enter "Roundabout" as the Zone Name (optional).
3. Then use the `Program > Write to Radio` menu to send the program to your D878.

### Icom IC-705

*These have been tested with the Icom-705.  If you have an Icom 7300 (or other Icom radio), please
let us know if this file is also compatible with your radio.*

1. Download and install the [Icom CS-705 Software](https://www.icomjapan.com/support/firmware_driver/3067/).
2. Connect a USB cable from your computer to the Icom 705.
3. Use the `COM Port > Setting...` command to select the COM port used by the USB connection.
4. Use the `Clone > Read <- TR` menu to duplicate the Icom's settings to your computer.
5. Click on `Memory CH > <<Add Group>>` to create a new group of memory channels for the repeater roundup channels.
6. Select the new group and use the `File > Import > Group` menu and select the downloaded <a href="asserts/programming_files/icom.csv" download>icom.csv</a>file.
